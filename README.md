# SecureLogin

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.3.

In this project I have implemented secure authentication and authorization of user with Firebase 

This Project has two main modules one is login and other is sign up module 
Those Modules are implemented with the help of lazy loading so these modules are loaded on-demand


on signUp/register component I have applied the form validators 
once the valid credentials are entered submit button will be enabled othervise it won't
